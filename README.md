# FlickrStroll
A simple Android app that tracks walking distance, fetches a new outdoor photo every 100 meters and displays the photo stream. The photos are provided by the public [Flickr Search API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html). This code was written as part of a coding challenge within the span of a day.

# Setup
To build the app successfully, a Flickr API key must be provided within the _local.properties_ file (base directory), as such:
FLICKR_API_KEY=<INSERT_API_KEY>

A key can easily be generated following this [link](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply).
